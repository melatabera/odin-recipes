# odin-recipes
This is my first Odin project, found in the introduction module of the course. For this project, I utilized HTML to create a basic webpage that dispalys three recipes from allrecipies.com. In each page, there is an image with a description, ingredients needed for the recipe, and step-by-step directions on how to make the meal.
